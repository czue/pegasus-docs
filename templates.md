# Information about Templates

*This documentation is a work in progress*

All Pegasus templates are found in `/pegasus/templates/`.
These include Pegasus's own templates, as well as overridden templates from other apps.

Pegsaus's templates are found in `/pegasus/templates/pegasus`.

The `app` directory contains templates within the application, e.g. after sign in.

Any `components` subdirectory contains partial templates relevant to that directory.
E.g. `app/components` contains partial templates used within the application.
